# Data Science Projects Repository

This repository showcases a variety of **machine learning and data science projects**.

## Repository Structure

### 1. Data Visualization and Dashboarding (WIP)
This section includes projects focussing on gathering insights using **data visualization and dashboarding**. 

**Weather Forecasting**
This project scrapes data from openweathermap.org site, and generates weather insights for multiple cities in US. 
Later, these are then displayed in a **Tableau** interactive dashboard for the user to play around.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
This section includes implementations of popular ML algorithms on some kaggle datasets using an OOPS based approach.
Additionally, this also includes code to develop machine learning algorithms built from the ground up using Python.

**regressors_from_scratch.ipynb:** Explore various regression techniques for numerical prediction tasks.
- Linear Regression  
- Logistic Regression

**kaggle_predicting_housing_prices.ipynb** Performing EDA on the `housing_prices` dataset, developing and testing various models using an OOPS based approach and finding the best performance.

### 3. Deep Learning Model
This section includes implementation of deep learning model from scratch on a sample digits dataset. 
The idea here is to showcase how forward and backward propagation works, and how to train a model from scratch.

Note: To look for .py scripts directly, and not notebooks, go to src/ folder.
